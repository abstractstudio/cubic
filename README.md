# Cubic
Cubic is a cooperative, multiplayer physics game that features mechanical simplicity yet challenging gameplay. As a cube, the player must navigate the map in order to physically reach the goal. This might include utilizing the realtime physics, interacting with the environment, or even using other players. 

## Status
As of 1/29/2016, Cubic is currently in early alpha development. Although we have the rough frameworks for the camera and physics working, movement and rendering still have to be debugged.

## Timeline
We hope to have the basic singleplayer movement finished in the next few weeks (school permitting). Optimally, we will also have networking done by then.
